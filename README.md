## ðŸ’» About the Project

To combine my passions for code, writing, and design, I created this personal portfolio that showcases my experiences and accomplishments so far. I crafted every aspect of the portfolio with the goal of maintaining the flexibility, effectiveness, and simplicity of code and design.

For more technical details about the project, take a look at the [development documentation](/web-app/README.md).
